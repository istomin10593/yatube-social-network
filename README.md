## &#9989; Overview

Yatube is a social network where authors can share their thoughts and ideas. Create posts with pictures, put them in groups, follow your favorite authors and leave comments under your favorite posts.

 **Yatube social network** is a web server based on a powerful modular OOP and Django framework, which contributes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
It is designed with the KISS principle in mind and all source code can be easily and quickly read and understood. The design principle is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), aimed at reducing the repetition of information of all kinds (without code duplication), and the YAGNI principle, to avoid unused code/unnecessary functionality in the software.

The application is fully covered by Unit Tests.
